    <p>This is an instant classic! Nothing wrong with good 'ol spaghetti. This is hard to screw up.</p>

    <p>Any kind of noodles will do. Any kind of sauce will do. Once again, we're going to cover a multitude of sins with the hot sauce here. We won't behave like total heathens, though. We will cook the pasta appropriately.</p>
